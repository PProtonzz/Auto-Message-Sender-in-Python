# Auto Messages Sender in Python By PRANAV FULKARI
A python code to post messages automatically. It's made for my friend to annoy him using facebook/whatsapp Comment.

Things must need:

1. A computer with python3 installed
2. pyautogui library installed.

# Install pyautogui

```
(pip install pyautogui)
```
If it says permission denied, try:
```
python3 -m pip install --user pyautogui
```

Point the cursor at text box or comment box and the robotic system will automatically type, and post text for n times. If you change the number this can go to infinity too.

# Warning: This might violate rules and regulations, use it at your own risk.
# Don't get blocked for robotic commenting.
